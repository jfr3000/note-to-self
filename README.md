# Note to Self

**Work in progress!**

Note to Self is a desktop app for daily short journal entries of 280 characters length. Like 280daily.com, but with better control of where your entries end up.

Note to Self will remind you daily and give you a choice of where you want to save your entries in JSON format.

I mostly built this for myself because I've found that having to write just a small amount motivates me to actually keep a journal of whatever is most important at the time.
